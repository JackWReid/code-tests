# NEVERBLAND Coding Challenge

"We built a prototype of an application that let the user search for a movie and get some informations about it. This application has to be simple but can potentially scale as a mid-range project in the future.
We just received the design from the graphic designer and it needs to be implemented.

How would you implement the design using your own methods and workflow?

Don't hesitate to be creative and interpret the design as you want.

Keep in mind that you don't need to implement everything.
We just want to have a taste of your way of working with design and code!

Good coding!
